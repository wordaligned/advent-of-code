# Advent of Code

Selected solutions to the set of puzzles on [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl)'s
excellent <http://adventofcode.com> site.

From [the site](http://adventofcode.com/about):

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a
variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as
appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a
beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon
different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

First time through, I solved all the puzzles using Python, leaning on
its standard containers, [algorithms][itertools] and text processing
powers. Now I'm returning to the puzzles and exploring alternative
solutions, for the practice.

## [Day 22][22]

This is the puzzle I finished last. I had trouble understanding the
problem description, then I failed to transcribe the specification of
the spells correctly. The spells themselves differ in ways that make
the code tricky: some have instant results, some have extended
effects, and the shield spell takes effect when cast and when it
expires. I also needed to prune the search space and game state to 
find the result.


## [Day 1][1]

All those parentheses suggest lisp for a solution, but I went for
`bash` and `awk`. The input is all on one line which doesn't work well
with awk. Here's how to work around that:

    while read -n 1 c ; do echo $c; done

## [Day 2][2]

Awk again. Much as I like `awk` I almost never use it, and attempting
this simple question reminded me why. Why isn't `min` a builtin
function, for example?

## [Day 3][3]

I wrote a C++ solution system tested using the supplied
examples. C++14 is more convenient for handling coordinate pairs
than C++98 was. I find it easier to write C++ than `bash`.

I used [lambdas for the second part](./day3b.cpp), more to
practice using them than because it was the easiest thing to do. You
can't use `auto` everwhere, it seems, but `std::function` fills the
gaps.

## [Day 4][4]

Easily and swiftly done in Python. Slowly but correctly in `bash`

    $ time ./day4.sh 
    117946
    
    real	7m29.612s
    user	2m46.140s
    sys 	5m26.347s

## [Day 5][5]

This [bash script](./day5.sh) filters out the naughty strings using
`grep`, `tr` and `bash` builtins. Pipe its output through `wc -l` to
get the number of nice strings:

    ./day5.sh < input5 | wc -l

The second part of the puzzle just needs `grep`. Filter the nice
strings like this:

     grep -E "(..).*\1" | grep -E "(.).\1"

or count them:

     grep -E "(..).*\1" | grep -Ec "(.).\1"

## [Day 10][10]

This is all about the looksay numbers. In Python, you can represent a
number as a list of digits, then use [groupby][] and [chain][] to produce the
next number.

    from itertools import *
    
    def looksay(n):
        flatten = chain.from_iterable
        return list(flatten([len(list(g)), d] for d, g in groupby(n)))

I wrote another [solution](./day10.go) in `go`, which doesn't offer
these higher level algorithms. It looks rather like C code.

## [Day 6][6]

Awk works out nicely for this one, and I've learned a little more
about the language. Arrays are, in fact, associative containers. In
this case, we have a two dimensional grid of lights which are being
switched on and off as specified in a list of instructions.

    turn on 296,50 through 729,664
    turn on 212,957 through 490,987
    toggle 171,31 through 688,88
    turn off 991,989 through 994,998

We can pick out the numbers by setting the field separator, `NF`, to
the regex pattern "[ ,]". We model the grid as an array, `lights`,
accessing the light at `(x, y)` as:

    lights[x,y]

The syntax is nice, but what actually happens is that the indices, x
and y, are concatenated with a separator between them. Awk is highly
dynamic. Scoping can be surprising. Variables come into being as
needed and zero initialised. Split long lines using an escape
character `\` -- parenthesising won't do.

## [Day 8][8]

An interesting puzzle. You can quickly and safely solve it using
Python to [eval][] the string. By safely, I mean you'll get an
exception thrown on malformed input.

    strings = open('input8').read().splitlines()
    print(len(eval('+'.join(strings))) - sum(map(len, strings)))

My [alternative solution](./day8.go) written in Go is longer and more
fiddly.
