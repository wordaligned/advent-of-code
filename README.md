# Advent of Code

Selected solutions to the set of puzzles on [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl)'s
excellent <http://adventofcode.com> site.

From [the site](http://adventofcode.com/about):

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a
variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as
appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a
beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon
different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## [Day 22][22]

This is the puzzle I finished last. I had trouble understanding the
problem description, then I failed to transcribe the specification of
the spells correctly. The spells themselves differ in ways that make
the code tricky: some have instant results, some have extended
effects, and the shield spell takes effect when cast and when it
expires. I also needed to prune the search space and game state to 
find the result.


## [Day 1][1]

All those parentheses suggest lisp for a solution, but I went for
`bash` and `awk`. The input is all on one line which doesn't work well
with awk. Here's how to work around that:

    while read -n 1 c ; do echo $c; done

## [Day 2][2]

Awk again. Much as I like `awk` I almost never use it, and attempting
this simple question reminded me why. Why isn't `min` a builtin
function, for example?

## [Day 3][3]

I wrote a C++ solution system tested using the supplied
examples. C++14 is more convenient for handling coordinate pairs
than C++98 was. I find it easier to write C++ than `bash`.

I used lambdas for the second part, more to practice using them than
because it was the easiest thing to do. You can't use `auto` everwhere,
it seems, but `std::function` fills the gaps.
